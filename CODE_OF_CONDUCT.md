# üåç Code of Conduct

## Purpose üéØ

Welcome to our open-source community!

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of background, experience, or identity. This Code of Conduct outlines the expectations for all contributors, maintainers, and participants to ensure a positive and productive collaboration experience ‚Äî especially during community-driven events such as **Hacktoberfest**.

We're building **SauLM** ‚Äî an AI-powered legal assistant that makes legal information more accessible through persona-based interactions. Whether you're a developer passionate about AI, a student learning about RAG systems, a legal professional interested in technology, or someone exploring open source for the first time, we're excited to have you here.

Our goal is to build a community where learning, contribution, innovation, and mutual respect thrive.

Thank you for being part of our journey to make legal technology more accessible! ‚öñÔ∏è‚ú®

## Legal and Ethical Considerations ‚öñÔ∏è

Given that SauLM is a legal assistant AI, we emphasize additional responsibilities:

### Educational Purpose üéì
This project is built for educational and assistive purposes. Contributors should:
* Understand that SauLM provides general legal information, not legal advice
* Never intentionally modify the system to provide misleading or harmful legal guidance
* Be transparent about the limitations of AI in legal contexts
* Consider the real-world impact of the tool on users seeking legal assistance

### Data Responsibility üîí
When working with legal documents:
* Never upload real confidential legal documents for testing without proper anonymization
* Respect privacy and data protection principles in all contributions
* Follow secure coding practices, especially around document processing and storage
* Be mindful of sensitive information in issues, PRs, and discussions

### Persona Integrity üé≠
SauLM uses distinct personas (Harvey Specter, Saul Goodman, Matt Murdock) for user engagement:
* Respect the creative and educational intent of these personas
* Maintain consistency with each persona's established characteristics
* Avoid contributions that would make personas provide unethical guidance
* Keep humor and character traits appropriate and professional
